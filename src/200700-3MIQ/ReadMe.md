Are you familiar with 3MIQ, three most important question and goal setting process?


Yes, I am familiar with the 3MIQ (Three Most Important Questions) goal-setting process. It was developed by Vishen Lakhiani, founder of Mindvalley, as an alternative to traditional goal setting. 

The process is designed to help individuals distinguish between "means goals" (outdated societal benchmarks like specific job titles or degrees) and "end goals" (what truly leads to fulfillment). 

The **Three** Most Important Questions

The process involves spending a short amount of time (often just a few minutes per question) brainstorming answers to these three categories: 

1. What **experiences** do you want to have in this lifetime?
Focuses on the things you want to feel, see, and experience, such as traveling, specific relationships, or adventures, without worrying about how you will pay for or achieve them.

2. How do you want to **grow**?
Focuses on your personal development, including new skills you want to learn, character traits you want to embody (like leadership or resilience), and your spiritual or intellectual evolution.

3. How do you want to **contribute**?
Focuses on the legacy you want to leave and how you want to give back to your family, community, or the world at large. 
Key Benefits
Clarity of Purpose: It bypasses societal "rules" to reveal what your soul actually desires.
Speed: The exercise is often done as a "fast-fire" brainstorm to prevent overthinking and let your intuition lead.
Holistic Vision: Unlike traditional business-centric goal setting, it covers personal, emotional, and social fulfillment.
